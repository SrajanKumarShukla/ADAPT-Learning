// Try to predict what you will get for half(x), half(4), and half(3). It is simple to predict what you will
// get for half(4), but, depending on your programming background, it might not be so easy to predict
// what you will get for half(x) and half(3). Call half(x), half(4), and half(3) and see if you were right.
// 4. Try to predict what you will get if you evaluate x in the console. Is it still 5, or is it 3? Try it and see.
// 5. Enter this function into the console:
// function seven() {
// x = 7;
// return(x);
// }
// Call seven() in the console. Try to predict what you will get if you evaluate x in the console. Try it
// and see. How do you explain the surprising result?
