/**
 * 40.

6. Make a function called calculation that, given three numbers a, b, and c, returns (a + b)/c. Try it
with a few normal values. Then, try to predict what you will get for calculation(1, 1, 0), calculation(-
1, -1, 0), and calculation(1, -1, 0). Try those tests and see if you get what you expected.
