<!-- Assuming that the Rectangle constructor takes a width and a height, why does the following output
20 instead of 200? (Hint: if you see an answer that seems too obvious to be what I am looking for,
it probably is the answer I am looking for.) -->

<p>In Q3 why does the following output 20 instead of 200?</p>

<script>
class Rectangle{
constrcutor(height,weight){
this.height=height;
this.weight=weight;
}
}
rectangle.prototype.area=function(){
console.log(this.height*this.weight);
}
r = new Rectangle(4, 5);
r.hieght = 50;
console.log(r.getArea());
console.log(r.height);
console.log(r.weight);
