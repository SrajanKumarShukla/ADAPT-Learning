<h2>Q5</h2>

<p>In Q5 Try reading the middleName property from your variable above. Try assigning to the middleName
    property.</p>

    <script>
        function person(firstName, lastName) {
            this.firstName = firstName;
            this.lastName = lastName;
        }
        
        const srajan = new person('srajan', 'kumar');
        console.log(srajan);
        console.log(srajan.middleName);
        // This gives undefined as the person class doesn't have middleName attribute in it.
// This is very useful because, it's kind of handling the error by itself and alerting the devloper to change/update the value
