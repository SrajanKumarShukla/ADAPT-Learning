<!-- Make a variable whose value is an object with firstName and lastName properties, but don’t define
a Person class first. Try looking up the first and last names. Try changing the last name. It seems
very odd to Java programmers to make an object without first defining a class, but JavaScript programmers
do this sort of thing all the time. -->
